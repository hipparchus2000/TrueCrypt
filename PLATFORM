currently i'm running the TRUSTKEY software on a FreeBSD 5.2.1 system 
I originally wrote the algorithms in yabsic, and now I've ported them
to GNU C++.

(yabasic that I used is in ./3rdParty).

yabasic was used orignally because I might use a PIC controller in a TRUSTKEY 
PDA , and a Basic compiler is easy to get.

Hardware I'm using is X86 (A Pentium 200 with 64 meg of RAM that I got for Free!).
